                I was born to a Mexican-American family that lived in Houston, Texas, making me a proud Houstonian! Growing up in the suburbs
                in the early 2000s there wasn't much to do, at least not outside. On the days where the Texas sun was too much to bear my brothers
                and I would stay inside playing videogames, which would be the catalyst for my love of technology. By the time I was 14 I had built
                my first PC. It was on this PC that I learned some of the basics of HTML and CSS through a course on Udemy while I was in highschool 
                When I graduated I knew I wanted to pursue being a Software Engineer!

                I attended College for 2 years pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, right before I signed up for the next semester I was
                told about an opportunity for software engineers at a coding bootcamp by my Uncle. I decided that it sounded like a great path
                to take and attended the bootcamp. The 15-week program was harder than any semester I had experienced up until this point, but it
                also taught me the most valuable skills pertaining to my line of work! I came away from it with literacy in Javascript, Ruby, CSS, and 
                HTML; experience with React and Rails; and with two fully functioning Web Apps which I have deployed and which you can test for yourself
                under "Projects"!
